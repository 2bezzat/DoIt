# Do It

Do it is just a simple python application which makes you organize your life and tasks 
you write the task  name on it and then specifiy the working time for that task and when you finish it will store it 

so you can at any time see what tasks have you done and how much time did you spend on it ,when and for how long :D 

enjoy it :D
